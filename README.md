# Web-Parser with Python

## Objective 
Given any query of words, possibly along with Boolean operators, the phrase operators and parentheses,design and implement a parser (some generalization of binary
expression trees) to analyze and to calculate the documents that are relevant to the query.Below is a list of typical queries:\
* Q1= adventures tom sawyer\
* Q2 = adventures + tom + sawyer\
* Q3 = tom ! sawyer\
* Q4 = “tom sawyer”\
* Q5 = ((adventures “tom sawyer ”) + huck) ! huckleberry\
